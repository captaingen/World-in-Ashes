 #Ideas
  RUS_tsarist_autocracy:0 "Tsarskoye Samoderzhaviye"
  #The flavor text directly below will be redone soon-ish
  RUS_tsarist_autocracy_desc:0 "The Tsarskoye Samoderzhaviye, or Tsarist Autocracy, is a form of government seen in the Russian Empire, however existed as far back as the Grand Duchy of Moscow. It is headed by an absolute monarch, with all power and wealth being distributed by them, to an extent even greater than that of western monarchies. Despite the creation of a constitution and the Duma in 1906, the Imperator still holds great power over the nation, with the previously mentioned mostly being for show. The head of state also wields immense power over religious issues within the nation and church."
  russian_armistice:0 "Russian Armistice"
  russian_armistice_desc:0 "Signed in 1930, the armistice brought an end to a nearly 15 year long struggle between the Bolsheviks and the Empire. Despite no clear winner existing, both nations fought on until their resources were drained and there men laid dead on the battlefield. While the armistice has been championed by many as an end to Russian struggles, some are worrying it may not last. Despite the great harm the war did to both sides, the political motivations for the war have simply strengthened during the times of peace. Beyond that the armistice has become infamous among the Russian populace, with some feeling it was a humiliation for their cause. Even though both nations were near collapse by the end of the previous conflict, the fires of war may ignite once again."
  RUS_conscription_exemptions:0 "Conscription Exemptions"
  RUS_conscription_exemptions_desc:0 "The Russian Empire has had a long history of exemptions from conscription. The responsibility of military service often fell upon Russians, with anyone from Finns to Muslims being exempt at some point in history, in fact almost half of the possible conscripts being able to avoid service due to various reasons. While the level of exemptions did fall during the civil war due to the Empire losing much of the land which housed non-Russians, the exemptions still have a profound impact on the status of the Russian military."
  RUS_remaining_bolsheviks:0 "The Remaining Bolsheviks"
  RUS_remaining_bolsheviks_desc:0 "Immediately after the civil war ended and the armistice was signed, both sides agreed to hand over prisoners of war, the dead, and most importantly, those who seek refuge in a chosen state. This was both in an attempt to begin reconciliation and lower tensions, however also to allow people to live on their side of the ideological divide despite the loose borders. An unexpected consequence of this however was the possibility of the Bolsheviks seeking to stay within the Empire. This has begun a recent uproar within the nation as more communists and socialists begin to come out of the woodwork, with some even suggesting a purge to remove them from our borders."
